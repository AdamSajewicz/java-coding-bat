# java-coding-bat
In this repo I present my solutions for all the CodingBat excercises.
CodingBat is a set of algorithmic problems, and with them you may practice your Java skills.

Most of them are just copied with its descriptions from the CodingBat page. To run a certain problem, you must do the following:
1. create a static void main method,
2. make the method you'd like to test static as well,
3. within the main method create manually a set of test data, for instance: an aray of ints, a string, etc. You may use test cases from CodingBat page
4. optionally, you may need add a command at the end of the method under test, to print the output to the screen (console) 
5. within the main method invoke the solution-method of your choice, with the prepared data as arguments.

Last step is just to run the program.
